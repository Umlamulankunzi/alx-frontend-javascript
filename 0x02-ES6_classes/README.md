This repository aims to provide a collection of tasks focused on facilitating the learning process of utilizing classes in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). By engaging with these tasks, I gained a practical understanding of how to effectively employ classes within their JavaScript code.

## Task Overview
The tasks included in this project are specifically designed to enhance comprehension and mastery of ES6 classes. Each task presents a unique scenario or problem that can be solved utilizing class-based approaches. By completing these tasks, I am developing valuable skills in leveraging the power and flexibility of classes in ECMAScript 2015.
